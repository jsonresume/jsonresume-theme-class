# In English, the dates are written in MMM YYYY format. Node.js will convert it
# to each locales equivalent on its own.
#
# For example:
#
# * English → Oct 2021
# * Bosnian → Oct 2021
# * Dutch → okt 2021
# * French → oct. 2021
# * German → Okt. 2021
#
# If a start date of a tenure is defined, but not an end date, in most sections
# we show the end date as `Present`. So the résumé would display something like
# `Oct 2021 - Present`.
#
# If it matters to you, please consider the capitalization of the date when
# deciding how to capitalize the translation of `Present`.
